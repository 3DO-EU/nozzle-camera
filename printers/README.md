# 3DO NOZZLE CAMERA

After seeing a lot of cool nozzle camera videos with hacked-up endoscopes...
We decided to make a real "Nozzle Camera" for 3D printers.
We ended up making this.
-	MIPI Camera with external USB webcam encoder (to make camera as small as possible)
-	Fixed focus lens (AF lenses starts to shake a loses focus when moving fast)
-	Custom FEP+Silicone USB cable, as we couldn’t find any high temp flexible USB cables on the market.
-	Custom SK6812 WWCW LED, we wanted as much light as possible while keeping the SK6812 protocol, therefore we ended up making our own led’s similar to RGBW just with only white diodes inside.
-	Two versions to have 2 different price points (IMX258 and OV5648)
